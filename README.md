# I Love Dots
The Idea
-------
A Game where the player taps a random appearing ball in the amount of time allotted to them.

TODO:
-
- ~~Generate Random Numbers to generate a random position~~
- Pseudo-randomly generate different colors for each ball (Kind of done)
- ~~Check where the player taps~~
- ~~Score Counter~~
- Start/End Screens (Kind of done)
- ~~Sound Effects~~
- Ad Implementations
- Code Cleaning
- ~~HighScore Counter~~ (Also saves highscore)
- Different Gamemodes
- ~~Timer~~
